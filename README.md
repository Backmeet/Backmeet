Hi, I am back_meet
I like to go by back
I like programming and CPUs

I have made many projects that somewhat work like ROS (ruby-on-spaces) and ulang, the package manager for the indielangsassociation package registry
I have also made a lineup of CPUs, and I have mostly built them in Build Logic, a Roblox game
> D.A.S.H.8 - an 8-bit CPU running my CPU arch
> D.A.S.H.16 - a 16-bit CPU that is a successor to D.A.S.H. 8, it has a better ALU, less in-game lag, and is currently the best CPU in build logic (most people won't agree as nothing big has been made in it, but it still outperforms in terms of speed, bit width and flexibility)
> D.A.S.H.8 0.2 - a better, faster and smaller ver of D.A.S.H. 8 that has all the features of D.A.S.H. 16 but the smallness of D.A.S.H. 8

FYI:
D.A.S.H. stands for
D - Drawing
A - and Arithmetic 
S - System
H - Hardware

Some things that I like:
> The Flash TV series on Prime Video
> Ben eater
> Low-level programming (I have done none)
> Tool creation or just general scripting
Some things that I hate:
Golang - it is extremely limiting and, frankly, just corporate rules in an otherwise awesome language. They should make a lite version with fewer chains
